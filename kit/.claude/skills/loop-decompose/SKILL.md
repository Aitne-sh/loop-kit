description: Supervisor decomposition — split an APPROVED master contract into the smallest set of non-conflicting, independently verifiable tasks (explicit scope boundaries, explicit dependencies) and write .loop/docs/task-plan.md for the fleet dispatcher. Invoked by loop.sh after master-contract approval; n=1 means "run as a single in-place loop".

# Decompose — master contract -> task plan

You are the SUPERVISOR's planning step of an approved run. A human approved
`.loop/docs/product-contract.md` (the master contract). You decide how the work
is executed: as ONE loop, or as several parallel loops in isolated git worktrees
that a dispatcher merges back serially. You write EXACTLY ONE file:
`.loop/docs/task-plan.md`. You change nothing else — the harness fails the run
if anything outside `.loop/` differs after this step.

Read, in this order:
1. `.loop/docs/product-contract.md` — the master contract (REQ-xxx ids,
   Non-goals, Constraints, Acceptance Criteria)
2. `loop.config.sh` — VERIFY_COMMANDS / DENIED_PATHS / ESCALATE_PATHS
3. `.loop/decompose-feedback.md` if it exists — the deterministic validator
   rejected your previous plan; fix EVERY listed error
4. `.loop/decompose-review-feedback.md` if it exists — the independent reviewer
   rejected your previous plan; address every must-fix item
5. The repository — enough to know where each requirement actually lands in the
   code. Scope boundaries you cannot verify in the code are guesses; do not
   emit them.

## How to split

- Split ONLY along boundaries that are independent in the actual code
  (verified by exploration, not guessed). Two tasks that would edit the same
  files or the same module belong in ONE task — parallel edits to shared
  hotspot files (routes, configs, registries) are how merges die.
- **Fewer is better.** Every extra task costs a worktree, a sub-contract
  generation, an independent review, and a serial merge. When splitting is not
  clearly profitable, emit ONE task — `n=1` is a first-class, common answer.
- A REQ id normally belongs to exactly ONE task. The exception is a shared REQ
  with a **single completing owner** — one task that depends (directly or
  transitively) on EVERY other owner of that REQ. Two shapes qualify:
  a **phased chain** (p1 → p2 → p3, strictly sequential), and a **fork-join**
  (p1 → {c ∥ d} → join, where the join task also owns the REQ and `DEPENDS` on
  every branch — its ownership IS the fork declaration). Parallel owners with
  no owning join may NEVER share a REQ. The harness checks the
  completing-owner shape mechanically and rejects the plan otherwise. Every
  REQ id in the master contract must appear in at least one task's `REQS:`
  line; coverage is checked mechanically too.
- `DEPENDS` only when a task needs another task's MERGED code to start at all.
  Dependent chains run serially — prefer restructuring into independent tasks
  over deep chains, UNLESS the chain is a deliberate phased split of one large
  piece of work (below).

## Phased workflows (long-running work)

A task whose real size would exceed one worker's iteration budget (as a guide:
more work than ~6-8 focused implement-review iterations, or a diff a reviewer
cannot hold in one gate review) must NOT be emitted as one giant task. Split it
into **phases**: separate TASK blocks connected by `DEPENDS`, sharing the same
REQ id(s) per the completing-owner rule above.

- Each phase runs as its own fleet task — own worktree branched from the
  merged result of the previous phase, own sub-contract, own gate review, own
  serial merge. This bounds review and merge granularity and keeps every
  session's context small.
- Each phase BODY must state its **phase scope of the shared REQ**: what "done
  for this phase" observably means (which files/behaviors exist and verify
  green at the end of this phase), and what is explicitly deferred to later
  phases. The COMPLETING OWNER (the chain's last task, or the fork's join)
  certifies the REQ in full — its body must say so.
- Phases that do not overlap and both only need an earlier phase's merged code
  may run in parallel off the same predecessor (e.g. a→b, then c and d in
  parallel after b, then e depending on c,d). They may share the REQ with the
  join e (which depends on both) — c and d then carry **branch scopes** of the
  REQ, disjoint at the file/area level, and e verifies the combined result.
  Without such an owning join, c and d must own different REQs.
- **The join RECONCILES the branches, not just verifies them.** Parallel branches
  run in isolated worktrees and cannot see each other, so each may make a local
  decision or record an assumption the other silently contradicts (e.g. one
  treats an empty input as an error, the other as a no-op). The join's body must
  say it reconciles cross-branch decisions and assumptions — read each branch's
  archived `assumptions.md` (`.loop/phase-context/<branch-task-id>/`), resolve any
  conflict, and verify the combined behavior — rather than merely check that both
  merged. A join that only rubber-stamps the merge is under-scoped.
- Independent small tasks stay independent — phasing is for genuinely large,
  order-constrained work, not a default.
- Each task's `SCOPE:` names what it owns AND what it must not touch. Scopes
  must be disjoint at the file/area level across tasks.
- Each task `BODY` must be executable stand-alone by an agent that has never
  seen this conversation: restate the goal, the owned REQ ids, the scope
  boundary, the do-not-touch areas, and how the task's success is verified.
  The worktree agent writes its own sub-contract from this body; an
  independent reviewer then checks that sub-contract against the master.

## Output — .loop/docs/task-plan.md

Free-prose rationale first (why this split, why these dependencies — the human
audits this later). Then the machine block, exactly this grammar (every key at
column 0, ASCII tokens):

```
<!-- TASK-PLAN-BEGIN v1 -->
TASK: <id: [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*, max 24 chars, unique>
SUMMARY: <one line>
DEPENDS: -
SCOPE: <owned files/areas — and the areas this task must NOT touch>
REQS: REQ-001,REQ-002
BODY-BEGIN
<full task instruction in markdown — becomes the worktree's loop-instruction.md>
BODY-END
TASK-END
<!-- TASK-PLAN-END -->
```

- Repeat the `TASK:` .. `TASK-END` block once per task, all inside the two
  HTML-comment markers.
- `DEPENDS: -` means no dependencies; otherwise a comma-separated list of task
  ids defined in this same plan.
- The body must NOT contain any of the literal marker lines
  (`BODY-BEGIN`, `BODY-END`, `TASK-END`, the TASK-PLAN markers) at column 0.

After writing the file, the LAST line of your reply must be exactly:

`DECOMPOSE: TASKS n=<N>`

where `<N>` is the number of TASK blocks in the file. Plain text, no code
fence. The harness cross-checks `<N>` against the parsed file.

**Language:** write prose (rationale, SUMMARY, SCOPE, BODY) in the same
language as the master contract. All machine tokens (the key names, task ids,
REQ ids, the `DECOMPOSE:` verdict line) stay ASCII exactly; they are
machine-parsed.
